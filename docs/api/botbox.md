# `Botbox`

The Python API is all asyncio. The agent classes are on the [harness pages](../harnesses/).

```python
Botbox(agent: Agent, *, dockerfile: str | Path | None = None, allow: Sequence[str] = ())
```

| Argument     | What it is                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`      | Which harness. See [Harnesses](../harnesses/).                 |
| `dockerfile` | Your layer on top of the agent's image. Build context is the Dockerfile's directory. Must end as `USER user` and leave the agent's home where it is. |
| `allow`      | Hostnames the proxy admits, in addition to the agent's own.    |

`Botbox` is an async context manager. Inside `async with Botbox(...) as box:`, SIGTERM cancels the task that entered the block, so a run or session in progress tears down, then the block raises `SystemExit(143)`. Any other cancel propagates as usual. A SIGTERM handler you set yourself is left alone, and off the main thread nothing changes. [`build()`](./build), [`run()`](./run) and [`session()`](./session) work without the block too.

Don't fork while a run is in progress. A forked child inherits the run's pipes and the event loop's state. Start a process pool before any run, or use the `spawn` or `forkserver` start method.

A sync caller wraps each call in `asyncio.run(...)`.
